## UX Improvements
- I added an state for the selected option, now is visible in the autocomplete component and also in "my favourites" section under the select.
- Each selection can be sorted alphabetically. 
- The selection are grouped in a country filter for easier exploring.
- User is able to remove favourites from the list and also from the search field. 
- Added BG and text to help user to understand the functionality of this site.
- Error msg when the api fails and user cannot find a city in the search field.
